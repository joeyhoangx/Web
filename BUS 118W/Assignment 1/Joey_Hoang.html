    <li>Review of the Lecture:</li>
    <ul><li>What I learned from this lecture is a lot about the HTTP Conecpts. I learned of the uses of TCP and how stateless, non-persistent, and persistent connection all have their different uses. I also learned more about the HTTP request message and what everything that is put means. For example, the Version that is shown and the URL. 
        <li>What I liked about this lecture was the images used within it. It makes it more enjoyable and easier to follow instead of it being a block of text which can get pretty confusing. Especially when he was explaining the HTTP request message format. With the different colors it made it easier to follow.</li> 
        <li>I would suggest for the future to talk a little bit slower as it was hard for me to keep up and I had to go back multiple times. Also, the background noise from the mic was a little distracting but I know there isn't anything you could do about it. Lastly, I would suggest showing yourself doing the coding instead of just having everything already layed out incase someone gets stuck and doesn't know what you did.   </li></ul></li>
